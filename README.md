## Wins
Despite the tight timeframe, I successfully utilized React and Cypress to deliver a functional and user-friendly app. I added a personal touch by creating custom icons and graphics, enhancing the site's style. One of the significant advantages of employing React in "Chomper's" is its component-based architecture, which promotes reusability and modularity. Breaking down the user interface into smaller, self-contained components streamlined and expedited the development process.
## Challenges & Improvements
I encountered challenges while handling different types of information pulled from the API. Dealing with older data required a different approach, and I had to find a solution to remove HTML elements from the API's summary. Additionally, I faced difficulties with error handling and redirecting the error path, as it didn't always display properly during testing. It took time to fix these issues by refining my error handling and ensuring the error path updated correctly.
