## Wins
Despite the tight timeframe, I feel that I successfully leveraged React and Cypress to deliver a functional and user-friendly app. I was also able to build something that has my perosonal touch as i was able to create custom icons and graphics elements imporvoing the style of the site. 

One of the major advantages of using React in "Chomper's" is its component-based architecture, which promotes reusability and modularity. By breaking down the user interface into smaller, self-contained components, the development process became more streamlined and efficient. This allowed for easier maintenance, updates, and future scalability of the application.
## Challenges & Improvements
I was chaallenged with the different information that could be pulled from the api older data had to be handled differnetly and the summary coming in from the API had html elements with in it that i had to reasearhc how to get rid of. Another challenge i faced with with the error handling and the redirect of the error path not allways diapling withint testing i was able to get it fix but took some time of coming of my error handling and ensuring that the error path updaated properly.
